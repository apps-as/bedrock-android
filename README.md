# bedrock-android

This project stands as a fundamental building block for a modern Android application. It creates the basics for a single Activity application using `Conductor` as the UI and navigation framework, `Dagger 2` for dependency injection, `LiveData` for data integration and `Coroutines` to drive background processing, fully written in `Kotlin`.
